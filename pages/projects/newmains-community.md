### Project description

The project will be delivered at the NCT Centre, which is a new purpose built community owned community centre in a central location within Newmains. As a new build it meet the latest environmental and access standards with free wi-fi access throughout the building. 

The project is aimed at the elderly, those seeking employment or benefits, however, the access to free wi-fi and the making available access to a lap top computer as required will help to serve the wider community. 

With the creation and build of the NCT Centre as a major project within Newmains a great deal of work has been put in with the development of partnerships to enable activities to meet local community needs to be delivered at the NCT Centre and removing one of the main barriers for the need to travel. 

This digital inclusion project aims at improving the basic digital knowledge and skills of the participant through running training as follows: 

* Elders 3 programmes of 1 hour per week sessions over 13 weeks periods for computer use 
	
* Elders 3 programmes of 1 hour per week sessions over 13 weeks periods for tablet use 

* Unemployed 3 x programmes of 2 hours per week sessions over 13 week periods on basic digital skills with focus on job search, cvâ€™s and job applications 

* Adult Learners 3 x programmes of 2 hours per session over 13 week periods on basic digital skills including where appropriate completion of benefit applications and job applications 

These classes will be arranged by the NCT Centre Manager in partnership with the local community NLC Community Learning and Development and New College Lanarkshire to maximise community participation and allow capture of any of the more difficult to reach. 

The funding will allow for the set-up of a portable IT Classroom that will be used by the participant of this project, one of the laptops, or more if necessary, will be made available on a daily basis for use by any member of the local communities to undertake work seeking employment and/or benefits. 

The greatest benefit that this project will bring is in making available locally the opportunity to take part in digital inclusion classes where these have traditionally been held in Wishaw and Shotts. These again have been poorly attended by Newmains residents due to their inability to travel through either financial, mobility or timing reasons.
